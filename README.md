# Project: The secrets behind popular restaurants

## Introduction
Popularity has become a really important criterion when we make a choice. It also applies to the dining industry. We've always preferred eating in a popular restaurant, as it will guarantee the food quality, dining environment and services, etc. Besides, it is also a good experience to post on social media. This project explores the restaurants in different neighborhoods based on Foursquare location data, and further, machine learning methods are used to find the factors that those popular restaurants share in common. The result can work as a guide to decision making, especially for restaurant operators and potential investors.

## Data Description
This study only uses Foursquare location data. The restaurants within a radius of 6 kilometers from a university are studied. The dependent variable is the rating of a restaurant. The predictors are:
1. whether this restaurant is verified (binary variables);
2. distance from the university;
3. located county (binary variables for each county);
4. whether there is any delievery provider (binary variables);
5. food categories (binary variables for each category);
6. Count of photos of this restaurant that are public;
7. price tier of the restaurant;
8. count of reviews;
9. how many people have added the restaurant to their list.
