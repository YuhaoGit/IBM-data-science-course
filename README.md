# Project: The secrets behind popular restaurants

Popularity has become a really important criterion when we make a choice. It also applies to the dining industry. We've always prefered eating in a popular restaurant, as it will guarantee the food quality, dining environment and services, etc. Besides, it is also a good experience to post on social media. This project explores the restaurants in different neighborhoods based on Foursquare location data, and further, machine learning methods are used to find the factors that those popular restaurants share in common. The result can work as a guide to decison making, especially for restaurant operators and potential investors.
